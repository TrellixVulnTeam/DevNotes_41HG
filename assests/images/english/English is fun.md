## SVC
To form sentence in english, we need only three things Subject, Verb and Compliment 

Example : 
The road is clean

| S | V | C |
| -- | -- | -- | 
| Road | Is | Clean

## Subject

A **subject** can be a noun or pronoun. 

### Noun 
Noun can be person name, place or a thing. (goku, earth, chicken)
A state of mind is also called noun. eg: affection and love.


## Vowels
Only by combining words we can coummincate any langauge, Vowels help you combine them. 

a.e.i.o.u | h

Don't give gap and speak the words that start with a.e.i.o.u, lets see some examples.

Pronunce w/o **GAP**

| Writing |  speaking |
| --------------- | -------- |
| Give **u**p |  Giveup |
| Put **o**n | Put-on |
| Come **i**n = Come-in |

### apostrophe
The marking of the omission of one or more letters (as in the contraction of do not to don't).

| words |  apostrophe |
| ---------- | -------- |
| I am  | I'm | 
| We are  | we're | 
| You are  | you're | 
| It is  | It's | 

**S V C** is always used. see, 
We - **subject**
are **verb**
compliment **awesome**

### In vowels **a.i.e.o.u | h**, silent **h** letter in sentences. 
| written |  spoken |
| --------- | ---------- |
| tell him | tell-im |
| send him out | send-im-out | 
| honest | aonest | 

### Silent "R"

RULE
- If "R" aplhabet comes last, pronounce it **lightly**. Eg: **Water | 'WATEr'**
- If it comes in the middle of a word, **SILENT IT**. Eg : **Morning | Moning**.

- Only say an < r > when it appears before a vowel sound.
- Never say an < r > when it appears before a consonant or at the end of a word.

So in the word ‘fork’, you don’t say the < r > because there is a consonant after it. In the name ‘Charlie’ you don’t say the < r > for the same reason. However in the word ‘grass’ we do say the < r > because there is a vowel sound after it.

Don't stress **"R"** letter when speaking, lets see some examples:

| written |  spoken |
| --------- | ---------- |
| morning | moning |
| warning | waning |
| nurse | nuse | 
| purse | purse |
| personal | personal | 
| purpose | pupose | 
| for you | fa you |
| near buy | nea-buy | 

Pronounce the "R" letter slightly, **don't stress err**

| written |  spoken |
| --------- | ---------- |
| water | water |
| paper | paper |


## Article

There are two articles, 
- Indefinite Articles : a | an
- Definite Article : the

Indefinite Articles :

Put an/a when a word starts with letter a.e.i.o.u
When to put an and a ?

Noun always comes with article,
Article doesn't come with name and place
| Voewls | words |

| A | An actor |
| E | An Engineer |
| I  | An Indian |
| O | An Orange |
| U An Umbrella |

Eg:

| Either | Ither | 
| Plumber | plumer |
| Restraunt | restrant |
| Honest | Onest  = an Honest |
| Half an hour | off an our |
| Hotel | Otel |

Definite Artilce 
"The" is a definite Article

For example, if I say, "Let's read the book," I mean a specific book. If I say, "Let's read a book," I mean any book rather than a specific book.

Here's another way to explain it: The is used to refer to a specific or particular member of a group. For example, "I just saw the most popular movie of the year." There are many movies, but only one particular movie is the most popular. Therefore, we use the.

Don't use the infront of places
Eg: The chennai : is wrong

Must use the for these,
The UK
The UAE

The 1st
The 2nd
The 3rd
The Next
The Last

When is the next train ?
When is the last bus ?
When is the wedding ?

When not to use "the"

next week | last week
last year | next year
last month | next month 

Eg : Just im going to home town next week

He went to school (Purpose: He went to school to study  )
He went to the school (Purpose:  he went to school to bring his child home )
