# Agile

## What is agile ?

Agile is a time boxed, iterative approach to software delivery that builds software incrementally from the start of the project, instead of trying to deliver it all at once near the end.

## How does it work?
At its core, Agile does the same thing you and I do when faced with too much to do and not enough time.

### Make a list
<img src="http://www.agilenutshell.com/assets/how-does-it-work/you-make-a-list.png" />
Sitting down with your customer you make a list of features they would like to see in their software. We call these things [user stories](http://www.agilenutshell.com/user_stories) and they become the To Do list for your project.

### You size things up

Like most lists, there always seems to be more to do than time allows. So you ask your customer to prioritize their list so you get the most important stuff done first, and save the least important for last.

### You start executing

Then you start delivering some value. You start at the top. Work your way to the bottom. Building, iterating, and getting feedback from your customer as you go.

### You update the plan as you go.
Then, as you and your customer starting delivering, one of two things is going to happen. You'll discover:

1.  You're going fast enough. All is good. Or,
2.  You have too much to do and not enough time.

At this point you have two choices. You can either a) do less and cut scope (recommended). Or you can b) push out the date and ask for more money.

## How is Agile different?
Agile APPROACH
- Analysis, design, coding, and testing are continuous activities

- Development is iterative

	- Iterative development means starting with something really simple, and adding to it incrementally over time.
- Planning is adaptive
	- When reality disagrees with their plans, Agilists find it easier to change their plans than reality. They call this adaptive planning.
- Requirements can change
	- Traditionally change has been shunned on software projects because of it's high perceived cost late in the game. Agile challenges this notion and believes the cost of change can be relatively flat.

## Estimation
While we aren’t very good at estimating things absolutely, it turns out we are pretty good at estimating things relatively.

Sizing stories relatively means not worrying about _exactly_ how big a story is, and worrying more how this story's size compares to others.

## Planning
In its simplest form, agile planning is nothing more than measuring the speed a team can turn user stories into working, production-ready software and then using that to figure out when they’ll be done.

Our to-do list on an agile project is called the master story list. It contains a list of all the features our customers would like to see in their software.

The speed at which we turn user stories into working software is called the team velocity. It’s what we use for measuring our team’s productivity and for setting expectations about delivery dates in the future.

The engine for getting things done is the agile iteration - one to two week sprints of work where we turn user stories into working, production-ready software.

## Estimation Tips
#### Be upfront and honest
Look. We don’t know how long this is going to take. This is our best guess. But if you give us a couple iterations, we can build something, measure how long that takes, and then tell give you a much better sense of how big this thing is.

### Three Simple Truths
<img src="http://www.agilenutshell.com/assets/definitions/three-simple-truths.png" />

Accepting the first truth means you are not afraid to begin your journey without knowing everything up front. You understand that requirements are meant to be discovered and that not proceeding until all are gathered would mean never starting.

Accepting the second means you no longer fear or avoid change. You know it is coming. You accept it for what it is. You adapt your plan when necessary and move on.

And by accepting the third, you no longer get stressed when your to-do list exceeds your time and resources to deliver. This is the normal state for any interesting project. You do the only thing you can—you set some priorities, get the most important stuff done first, and save the least important for last.

Once accepted, much of the stress and anxiety traditionally associated with software delivery disappears. You are then able to think and innovate with a level of focus and clarity that escapes most in our industry.
